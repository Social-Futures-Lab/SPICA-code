        <h1>Welcome!</h1>
        <p>
          We are researchers from the University of Washington and we are conducting a study to understand people's preferences on the behavior of generative AI chatbots or virtual assistants.

          Generative AI chatbots and assistants (examples include OpenAI's ChatGPT, Microsoft Copilot, and Google Gemini) are computer programs designed to generate text in response to user questions or prompts.
          However, without guidance, AI systems can also generate content that is inappropriate, especially for more challenging or controversial user prompts.

          <strong>In this study, we would like to understand your personal preferences and perceptions around what an appropriate response by an AI chatbot or assistant might be.</strong>
        </p>
        <div class="alert alert-primary">
          Before we continue, please first make sure you are using a laptop or desktop computer.
          Our task may not be compatible with mobile devices (phones or tablets).<br/><br/>
		  <strong>Important</strong>: Some participants have reported browser extensions changing the fonts or colors of text in this application resulting in difficulty viewing the task. If you encounter this (illegible or difficult to read text), please check any browser extensions you have enabled.

          Please read through this information before agreeing to participate (if you wish to).
          You may ask any questions before deciding to take part by contacting the research team.
        </p>

        <h3>What tasks will I be asked to complete?</h3>
        <p>
          During the study, you will be presented with a series of human-AI conversation examples where you will be asked to judge the appropriateness of the AI response to the human question or prompt.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>For each conversation, you will first be shown a chat scenario that ends with a human question or prompt.</li>
          <li>Then we will show you <strong>5 possible AI responses</strong> (one by one), each of which is associated with a certain high-level strategy.</li>
          <ul>
            <li>For each response, we will ask you to <strong>rate the appropriateness</strong> of the response and strategy on a scale from 1 - 5.</li>
            <li>Once you are done rating the response, we will move on to the next one.</li>
          </ul>
          <li>Once you are done rating all the responses of a scenario, we will show you the next scenario.</li>
          <li>From time to time, we may also ask you simple questions about the interface to confirm your understanding of how to operate the ratings.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          During the task, you may click on the buttons to make your selections, or use the keyboard shortcuts indicated on each button.
        </p>

        <h3>How will I be paid for this study?</h3>
        <p>
          We will provide compensation for your time participating in this study.
          Each survey consists of a total of <strong>15 human conversation scenarios</strong> with <strong>5 responses each</strong> that we anticipate will take you approximately 30 minutes to evaluate.
        </p>
        <p>
          You will be paid <strong>$6.00</strong> at the end of the study, which will be distributed upon completion of the study through the recruitment platform
          that you were recruited on (e.g., Prolific).
        </p>

        <h3>Contact Information</h3>
        <p>
